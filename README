== Installation

== Usage

== Development

If you want to develop it further, patch something or are just plain curious:
you're welcome.  This should get you started:

  $ git clone git://github.com/kronn/task_manager.git
  $ bundle install
  $ rake

Bundler is only used for installing dependencies. 

The usual pattern for github-projects applies:

* Fork the project.
* Add failing tests.
* Improve the code.
* Send me a pull request.

I'll take a look at it and try to integrate it. If I cannot apply your changes
or don't want to, I'll let you know.
